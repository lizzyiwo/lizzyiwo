Hi, I'm Elizabeth Eseoghene Williams 📊
Data Analyst | I’m excited about uncovering actionable patterns in business and customer data that drive smarter decisions and reveal hidden opportunities.

🔍 Analytical Focus
I get a real thrill from diving deep into customer behavior and business performance, figuring out exactly what makes people stay loyal, come back for more, or quietly churn, and then turning those hidden patterns into clear wins that actually move the revenue needle.
